# Summary
Macho is an email web archiving system, similar in scope to pipermail or
mhonarc.  It generates static html views of an email archive, organized
and indexed for easy browsing.

# Features
* Free (BSD license).
* Generates static standalone web archives that can be published without
  any custom server software.
* Reasonably efficient.  Macho caches previous work to allow for quick updates
  of large mail archives.
* Generates archives designed to be easily navigable by browsers that support
  type-ahead navigation and provides keyboard shortcuts for quick browsing.
